# anc_stm32
This project is about a simple active noise canclellation (ANC) system using one loudspeaker and one microphone. It consists of two parts; one that refers to system identification of the secondary path, using LMS algorithm and another that refers to producing the antinoise signal using FxLMS. It has been implemented in STM32F746G-DISCO board using a Shure MX 183 microphone and a simple JBL Go loudspeaker (3.1 W). We run first the system identification code and we store the coefficients of the secondary path in a file using receive_coeffs.py. Then we run stm32f7_fxlm_anc.c. The code waits for the secondary path coefficients identified in the previous step. Using send_coeffs.py we send the coefficinet and the ANC is ready to run by pressing the user's button of the discovery board. The programming of the board has been done using Keil.
